      Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic
      web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites
      like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.

      Web development is a specific field of software engineering that focuses
      on building web pages. Web pages, or web apps, are codebases that are
      downloaded and run in our web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) each time a
      user navigates to the website address. This differs from other software
      which is usually downloaded once and run as a standalone application on
      your computer or phone. Web development makes for an exciting career, as a
      web development cycle is usually much shorter and you get to iterate over
      your software at a much faster rate.
